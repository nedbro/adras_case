For Eclipse:

Extract this zip file to a folder (e.g. D:\case)
Create a new workspace (e.g. D:\workspace)
Open Eclipse in the new workspace
Choose Import - General - Projects from folder or archive, then select D:\cases\Andras_Case\András Case

The main method supports two operations: "train" and "decide". See included README file how to call main.

Installation instructions for other IDEs such as IntelliJ are similar.
